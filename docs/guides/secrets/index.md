# Managing Secrets

_How to securely provide API keys and credentials to docker-agent._

## Overview

docker-agent needs API keys to talk to model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and MCP tool servers (GitHub, Slack, etc.). These keys are **never stored in config files**. Instead, docker-agent resolves them at runtime through a chain of secret providers, checked in order:

| Priority | Provider | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Environment variables](#environment-variables) | `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` |
| 2 | [Docker secrets](#docker-compose-secrets) | Files in `/run/secrets/` |
| 3 | [`pass` password manager](#pass-password-manager) | `pass insert OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| 4 | [macOS Keychain](#macos-keychain) | `security add-generic-password` |

The first provider that has a value wins. You can mix and match — for example, use environment variables for one key and Keychain for another.

## Environment Variables

The simplest approach. Set variables in your shell before running docker-agent:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
docker agent run agent.yaml
```

Common variables:

| Variable | Provider |
| --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google Gemini |
| `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | Mistral |
| `XAI_API_KEY` | xAI |
| `NEBIUS_API_KEY` | Nebius |

MCP tools may require additional variables. For example, the GitHub MCP server needs `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`. These are passed to tools via the `env` field in your config:

```yaml
toolsets:
  - type: mcp
    ref: docker:github-official
    env:
      GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: $GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Env Files

For convenience, you can store secrets in a `.env` file and pass it to docker-agent with `--env-from-file`:

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_...
```

```bash
docker agent run agent.yaml --env-from-file .env
```

The file format supports:

- `KEY=VALUE` pairs, one per line
- Comments starting with `#`
- Quoted values: `KEY="value with spaces"`
- Blank lines are ignored

<div class="callout callout-warning">
<div class="callout-title">⚠️ Important</div>
<p>Add <code>.env</code> to your <code>.gitignore</code> to avoid committing secrets to version control.</p>
</div>

## Docker Compose Secrets

When running docker-agent in a container with Docker Compose, you can use [Compose secrets](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/use-secrets/) to inject credentials securely. Compose mounts secrets as files under `/run/secrets/`, and docker-agent reads from this location automatically.

### From a file

Store each secret in its own file, then reference it in `compose.yaml`:

```bash
echo -n "sk-ant-your-key-here" > .anthropic_api_key
```

```yaml
# compose.yaml
services:
  agent:
    image: docker/docker-agent
    command: run --exec /app/agent.yaml "Hello!"
    secrets:
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    volumes:
      - ./agent.yaml:/app/agent.yaml:ro

secrets:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:
    file: ./.anthropic_api_key
```

Docker Compose mounts the file as `/run/secrets/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. docker-agent picks it up with no extra configuration.

### From a host environment variable

In CI/CD pipelines, secrets are often injected as environment variables. Compose can forward these to `/run/secrets/`:

```yaml
secrets:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:
    environment: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
```

### Multiple secrets

```yaml
services:
  agent:
    image: docker/docker-agent
    command: run --exec /app/agent.yaml "Summarize my GitHub issues"
    secrets:
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
      - GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
    volumes:
      - ./agent.yaml:/app/agent.yaml:ro

secrets:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:
    file: ./.anthropic_api_key
  GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN:
    file: ./.github_token
```

### Why use Compose secrets over environment variables?

| Aspect | Environment Variables | Compose Secrets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Storage | In memory, visible via `docker inspect` | Mounted as tmpfs files under `/run/secrets/` |
| Visibility | Shown in process list and inspect output | Not exposed in `docker inspect` |
| Best for | Development | Production and CI/CD |

## `pass` Password Manager

docker-agent integrates with [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/), the standard Unix password manager. Secrets are stored as GPG-encrypted files in `~/.password-store/`.

### Store a secret

```bash
pass insert ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

The entry name must match the environment variable name that docker-agent expects.

### Verify it works

```bash
pass show ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

Once `pass` is set up, docker-agent resolves secrets from it automatically.

## macOS Keychain

On macOS, docker-agent can read secrets from the system Keychain. This is useful for local development — you store the key once and it's available across all your projects.

### Store a secret

```bash
security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s ANTHROPIC_API_KEY -w "sk-ant-your-key-here"
```

The `-s` (service name) must match the environment variable name that docker-agent expects.

### Verify it works

```bash
security find-generic-password -s ANTHROPIC_API_KEY -w
```

### Delete a secret

```bash
security delete-generic-password -s ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

Once stored, docker-agent finds the secret automatically — no flags or config needed.

## Choosing a Method

| Method | Best for | Setup effort |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Environment variables | Quick local development, scripts | Low |
| Env files | Team projects, multiple keys | Low |
| Docker Compose secrets | Containerized deployments, CI/CD | Medium |
| `pass` | Linux/macOS, GPG-based workflows | Medium |
| macOS Keychain | macOS local development | Low |

You can combine methods. For example, store long-lived provider keys in macOS Keychain and pass project-specific MCP tokens via env files.
